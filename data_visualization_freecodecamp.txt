                              Data Visualization with D3
===========================================================================================
D3, or D3.js, stands for Data Driven Documents. 

It's a JavaScript library for creating dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser.

d3.select('<tag>') 
=>selects html tag from the document and returns node 

.append('<tag>')
=>It appends an HTML tag to selected tag and returns node

.text('xyz...')
=>sets the text or gets the current text.

for example:
<script>
  d3.select("ul")
    .append("li")
    .text("Very important item");
</script>

.selectAll('<tag>')
=>select a group of elements and returns its node

.data()
=>used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.

to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the enter() method for this purpose.

When enter() is combined with the data() method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.
