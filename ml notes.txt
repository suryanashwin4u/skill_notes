1.Pandas is used for reading data and data manipulation.

2.numpy is used for computations of numerical data.

3.matplotlib is used for graphing data.

4.scikit-learn is used for machine learning models. 

5.Supervised learning is when we have a known target based on past data (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for).

6.unsupervised learning is when there isn't a known past answer (for example, determining the topics discussed in restaurant reviews).

7.Within supervised learning, there are classification and regression problems. 

8.Regression is predicting a numerical value (for example, predicting what price a house will sell for).

9.classification is predicting what class something belongs to (for example, predicting if a borrower will default on their loan).

10.machine learning models:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks.

11.The median can also be thought of as the 50th percentile. This means that 50% of the data is less than the median and 50% of the data is greater than the median. This tells us where the middle of the data is, but we often want more of an understanding of the distribution of the data. We�ll often look at the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile.The 25th percentile is the value that�s one quarter of the way through the data. This is the value where 25% of the data is less than it (and 75% of the data is greater than it).Similarly, the 75th percentile is three quarters of the way through the data. This is the value where 75% of the data is less than it (and 25% of the data is greater than it).

12.If there is an even number of datapoints, to find the median (or 50th percentile), you take the mean of the two values in the middle.

13.The standard deviation and variance are measures of how dispersed or spread out the data is, We measure how far each datapoint is from the mean.

14.Even though data is never a perfect normal distribution, we can still use the standard deviation to gain insight about how the data is distributed.

15.standard deviation is square root of variance.

16.use numpy for manipulating arrays.

17.First we import the package. It is standard practice to nickname numpy as np=> import numpy as np
