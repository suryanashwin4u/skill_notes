LECTURE NO.1:

economy is a dismal science , highlighted as depressing and poor science , a failed science and invaluable in nature

a discourse to study economic activities of the human being

all activities involving money are termed as economic activities

economics is a study of goods and services produced distributed and consumed in a territory 

it works on the principle of demand and supply

if we try to build a graph between price and quantity: supply increases then demand decreases both are inversely proportional to each other

which means goods are scarce and society must use its resources efficiently.

economic activities: All the activities concerned with profit, loss, livelihood, occupation, wage, employment, etc

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
after great depression the economics got divided into 2 broad branches: micro and macro economics

macro deals with tops-down approach, demand & supply, prices and income, input.
micro deals with bottoms-ups approach, effect on inflation, gdp, employment, effect.

                                    MICRO VS MACRO:
Meaning:
Microeconomics is the branch of Economics that is related to the study of individual, household and firm’s behaviour in decision making and allocation of the resources. It comprises markets of goods and services and deals with economic issues.	
Macroeconomics is the branch of Economics that deals with the study of the behaviour and performance of the economy in total. The most important factors studied in macroeconomics involve gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment, inflation and growth rate etc.

Area of study:
Microeconomics studies the particular market segment of the economy	
Macroeconomics studies the whole economy, that covers several market segments

Deals with:
Microeconomics deals with various issues like demand, supply, factor pricing, product pricing, economic welfare, production, consumption, and more.	
Macroeconomics deals with various issues like national income, distribution, employment, general price level, money, and more.

Business Application:
It is applied to internal issues.
It is applied to environmental and external issues.
 
Scope:
It covers several issues like demand, supply, factor pricing, product pricing, economic welfare, production, consumption, and more.	
It covers several issues like distribution, national income, employment, money, general price level, and more.

Significance:
It is useful in regulating the prices of a product alongside the prices of factors of production (labour, land, entrepreneur, capital, and more) within the economy.	
It perpetuates firmness in the broad price level, and solves the major issues of the economy like deflation, inflation, rising prices (reflation), unemployment, and poverty as a whole.

Limitations:
It is based on impractical presuppositions, i.e., in microeconomics, it is presumed that there is full employment in the community, which is not at all feasible.	
It has been scrutinised that the misconception of composition’ incorporates, which sometimes fails to prove accurate because it is feasible that what is true for aggregate (comprehensive) may not be true for individuals as well.

keynes is a father of macro economics

SECTORS AND TYPES OF ECONOMIES:

1.PRIMARY:agriculture,fuels,fishing,forestry,metals,minerals->red collar jobs(labour jobs)
2.SECONDARY:manufacturing,refining,production,food processing->blue collar jobs(labour jobs)
3.TERTIARY:service sector, transportation sector, communication sector->white collar jobs(semi skilled jobs)
4.QUATERNARY:banking,IT sector,education knowledge sector->white collar jobs(skilled jobs)
5.QUINARY:R&D,CEOs,Scientist,bureaucracy->gold collar jobs(highly skilled jobs)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WW ROSTOW PERSPECTIVE:

economies grow following 5 linear stages through the 3 main sectors:agriculture,industry and services
south east asian countries such as indonesia, philippines, thailand and vietnam were exceptions

any sector which have more than 50% contribution in a country gdp decides type of economy it is.

india is a tertiary sector(service sector) economy with 53.66% engagement in gdp of the country

western countries have witnessed the industrialization phase and are now facing saturation

industrial sector is at the 2nd spot and contributing around 31% of the indian gdp

the industrial sector is at the second spot and contributing around 31% of the indian gdp

indian economy proved wrong the thesis of ROSTOW as india directly jumped from primary to tertiary sector.

once heavily industrialized nations america-europe are now witnessing growth due to 60% contribution of service sector.

LECTURE NO.2:

why india is a mixed economy?
1.poverty alleviation
2.protection of poor
3.planned development of country
4.distribution of necessary resources

which is the best type of economy?
mixed economy as both state or private production work in an economy

after great depression of 1930 most of the countries starting turning to mixed economy

france was first mixed economy

Capitalist turning to mixed economy during depression/covid calamity
1.process of pauperisation of masses.
2.the governments took control of producing and supplying some basic goods and services which are known as public goods.
3.50% of gdp was spent on public good(schools, healthcare etc)
4.private goods were given free

-------------------------------------------------------
socialist countries started a new pattern known as market socialism

Market socialism is a theoretical concept (model) of an economic system in which the means of production (capital) are publicly or collectively owned, and the allocation of resources follows the rules of the market (product-, labour-, capital-markets).

oskar lange suggested the same things for the socialist economy

lange praised the state economy but suggested to look towards capitalist economy

advised market socialism(coined term)

china follows market socialism
