docker is a ecosystem that contain all the packages and os to run applications in an independent container
it includes docker client, server, machine, hub, compose

docker client(CLI) is a tool we issue commands for reaching out to docker server(daemon)
docker daemon is a service that runs on your host operating system. it is responsible for running containers

docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to build, run, and share applications with containers
the use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization

features of containerization:
flexible,lightweight,portable,loosely coupled,scalable,secure

Pros Of Virtual Machine
1.Multiple operating system environments can be used on the same computer.
2.VM improves system reliability and prevents system crashes. Even if it crashes, the host OS will not be affected because of isolation.
3.Provides a layer of security, if the VM is affected by some malware it will not result in a breach of security in the host OS.

Cons Of VM
1.Running multiple virtual machines can lead to an unstable output.
2.Virtual machines are less efficient and slow compared to a physical machine.
3.A virtual machine can be infected with the weaknesses of the host machine.

Pros Of Container
1.Containers can be as small as 10MB and you can easily limit their memory and CPU usage. So, they are lightweight.
2.Since they are small in size, they can boot up faster and can be quickly scaled too.
3.Containers are exemplary when it comes to Continous Integration and Continous Deployment (CI/CD) implementation.

Cons Of Container
1.Since the containers run on host OS, it has a dependency on the host underlying host Operating System.
2.Containers cannot all by themselves cannot provide security at a commendable level.
3.When the container is deleted if the data inside the container is lost. You will have to add Data Volumes in order to store the data.

==>sudo apt instal docker.io
==>sudo snap install docker

to know docker is installed or not:
==>docker

start docker service
==>sudo service docker start

stop docker service
==>sudo service docker stop

check all images,containers,other system docker information
==>docker info

uninstallation of docker
==>sudo yum remove docker


check docker version:
==>docker --version
==>docker -v

to run docker image
==>sudo docker run helloworld

to create docker image
==>sudo docker build -t docker_image_name

to check all images
==>sudo docker images

to check running docker
==>sudo docker ps -a
==>sudo docker ps

to stop docker
==>sudo docker stop

to stop forcefully docker
==>sudo docker kill

to view all commands in docker
==>sudo docker --help

to view all commands related to images
==>sudo docker images --help

to view all commands related to run
==>sudo docker run --help

to view all commands related to rmi
==>sudo docker rmi --help

to view all commands related to  ps
==>sudo docker ps --help

==>docker stop <container-id>

to check running containers and memory usages
==>docker stats

to check running containers,images and local memory usages
==>docker system df

to remove unused data
==>docker system prune

to login into docker
==>docker login





dockerfile
==>a dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command line instructions in succession.

docker image
==>it is a read-only template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the docker platform

docker container
==>it is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools,
system libraries and settings.

steps to make docker container:
1.create a docker file without any extension and write following text inside it:
FROM ubuntu:18.04
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y python3-pip
RUN pip3 install numpy
RUN pip3 install pandas
COPY run.py run.py
CMd ["python3","run.py"]

2.convert docker file into image in the same directory
==>docker build -t <docker-image-name> .

3.check images
==>docker images

check images quiet
==>docker images -q 

check images using filter
==>docker images -f "dangling=false" -q

4.run images or create container
docker run --name <new-image-name> <image-id>

5.check running containers list:
docker ps

6.run container and open its shell
docker run -it --name <new-image-name> <image-id> 
or
docker run -it --name <new-image-name> <repository-name>:<tag-name> 

7. ctrl + D to come out of infinite loop inside shell

8. if changes happened in docker file then we can rebuild that image to overlap previous one in the same directory
docker build -t <docker-image-name> .


to pull an image from dockerhub
==>docker pull <docker-image-name>

to remove an image
==>docker rmi <docker-image-id>

docker compose
==>tool for defining & running multi-container docker applications

use yaml files to configure application services:docker-compose.yml

check the validtity of file
==>docker-compose config

can start all services with a single command
==>docker compose up

can stop all services with a single command
==>docker compose down

can scale up selected services when required

to inspect a specific image
==>docker inspect <image-name | id>

to check history of a specific installation of images
==>docker history <image-name | id>

to pause running container
==>docker pause <image-name>

to unpause running container
==>docker unpause <image-name>


==>docker top <container-name | container-id>

==>docker stats <container-name | container-id>

==>docker attach <container-name | container-id>

image is a file that has all information about packages or dependencies to build a container in memory


check docker version
==>docker version

either download from docker hub or run hello world image locally
==>docker run hello-world

either download from docker hub or run redis image locally
==>docker run redis

either download from docker hub or run busybox image locally
==>docker run busybox

print hello world inside busy box
==> docker run busybox echo hello world

ping website inside busy box
==>docker run busybox ping www.xyz.com

type control + c to come out of the ping loop

list all directories inside busybox
==>docker run busybox ls

run shell and exit
==>docker run busybox sh

to list all containers running right now
==>docker ps

to list all containers that ran before (exited) and running(up) right now
==>docker ps --all

to stop specific docker container
==>docker stop <container_id>

to create a container
==>docker create <container_name>

to start a container and display output (-a=attach and output)
==>docker start -a <hash-string>

to check logs about container
==>docker logs <container-id>

to forcefully stop container
==>docker kill <container-id>

to open a specific container shell and execute commands, use ctrl + d to come out of it
==>docker exec -i -t <container-id> sh
