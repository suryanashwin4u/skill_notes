TypeScript is an open-source, object-oriented programing language, which is developed and maintained by Microsoft under the Apache 2 license
TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript which compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a language for application-scale JavaScript development, which can be executed on any browser, any Host, and any Operating System.
TypeScript is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file. TypeScript is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.
TypeScript source file is in ".ts" extension
TypeScript uses TSC (TypeScript Compiler) compiler, which convert Typescript code (.ts file) to JavaScript (.js file).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BENEFITS:
supports Static typing, Strongly type, Modules, Optional Parameters, etc.
supports object-oriented programming features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
fast, simple, and most importantly, easy to learn.
provides the error-checking feature at compilation time.
supports all JavaScript libraries
support reusability
make app development quick and easy
tooling support of TypeScript gives us autocompletion, type checking, and source documentation.
definition file with .d.ts extension to provide a definition for external JavaScript libraries.
supports the latest JavaScript features
gives all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity.
save a lot of time with TypeScript.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantage of TypeScript over JavaScript:

highlights errors at compilation time
supports strongly typed or static typing
runs on any browser
Great tooling supports with IntelliSense which provides active hints
namespace concept by defining a module

Disadvantage of TypeScript over JavaScript:

long time to compile
not support abstract classes
a compilation step is required

FEATURES OF TYPESCRIPT

1.Object-Oriented language
2.TypeScript supports JavaScript libraries
3.JavaScript is TypeScript
4.TypeScript is portable
5.DOM Manipulation
6.TypeScript is just a JS

The code written in TypeScript is compiled and converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the execution. This process is known as Trans-piled.
