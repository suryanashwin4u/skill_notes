uipath is a rpa tool used to guide digital robots to automate those tasks of web,windows application and citrix etc which are repetitive in nature, 
it has drag and drop functionality of activites.

it has community edition for free for learning purpose.

rpa: robotic process automation

uipath comes with 3 main components: 
1.uipath studio, 2.uipath robot, 3.uipath orchestrator.

uipath studio is a tool to design automation process in a visual manner, 
thru diagrams using drap and drop functionality.

uipath robot: robot executes the processes built in studio and scheduled in orchestrator.

uipath orchestrator: web app to deploy,schedule,monitor and manage robots and processes
It is a centralized robot management dashboard where we can easily deploy, secure and manage uipath robots.

it can manage environments, create and manage robot, robot performance monitoring, deploying and monitoring processes, assets management, managing package, managing logs, managing and stopping process, schedule jobs.

create a new sequence using ctrl + N then define properties and start designing

-----------------------------------------------
we can choose activities from the left section and drag-drop into our sequence for designing work flow

1.MESSAGE BOX: to show outputs messages.
2.INPUT DIALOG: to take values.
3.ASSIGN: to give variable a value internally.
 var_name.ToString()
 var_name.Substring(starting_index,ending_index)
 var_name.ToShortTimeString()

 to assign a current date to a variable: Now()
 to assign a current date and time string to a variable: Now().ToString()   
 to assign a current time to a variable: Now().ToShortTimeString()
 to assign a boolean values: True or False
4.WRITE LINE: to print output at console down below in uipath studio 

we can create a flowchart in uipath studio before designing process

GenericValue: it checks for first variable datatype then convert next variable into the same one to compute the results.
