C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.

Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:

The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.
The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data structure.


C is a structural or procedural oriented programming language which is machine-independent and extensively used in various applications.

used to develop from the operating systems (like Windows) to complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and many more

C++ follows the bottom-up approach

A namespace is a feature that groups the entities like classes, objects, and functions under some specific name.

C++ is a compiler-based programming language
