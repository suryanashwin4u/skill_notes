React Native is a JavaScript framework whereas ReactJs (React.js) is a JavaScript library.

React Native is based on React, JavaScript library of Facebook, and XML-esque markup (JSX) for developing the user interface.

It is also not a Hybrid app that builds over Ionic, Phone Gap, etc. that runs over WebView component.

React Native apps are the real native app, the JavaScript code stays as JavaScript, and they run in some extra thread by the compiled app. The user interface and everything are compiled to native code.

several advantages of React Native for building mobile applications:
Cross-Platform Usage,Class Performance,JavaScript,Community,Hot Reloading,Improving with Time,Native Components,Existence is Uncertain

Developing app using React Native framework requires Node, React Native command line interface, Python2, JDK, and Android Studio.


Steps to create React Native application
1. First, you have to start your emulator (Android Emulator) and make it live.

2. Create a directory (ReactNative) in your any drive.

3. Open "Command Prompt" and go to your ReactNative directory.

4. Write a command react-native init FirstApp to initialize your app "FirstApp".

5. Go to your directory location "FirstApp" and run the command react-native run-android. It will start Node server and launch your application in virtual device emulator.

React Native Code Explanation
import React, {Component} from 'react': imports the library and other components from react module and assign then to variable React.
const instruction: sets to display the platform-specific message.
export default class App extends Component: defines the classes that extend the React Component. The export default class modifier makes the class "public". This block of code defines the components that represent the user interface.
render(): a function that returns a React element.
return(): returns the result of layout and UI components.
View: a container that supports the layout accessibility controls. It is a fundamental component for building the UI.
Text: a React component for displaying text.
style: a property used for styling the components using StyleSheet.
styles: used to design individual components.
{styles.instructions}>{instructions}:
const styles = StyleSheet.create({}): The StyleSheet class creates the style object that controls the layout and appearance of components. It is similar to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) used on the Web.

RUN APP THROUGH EXPO IN PHONE

Install expo in pc
==>npm install -g expo-cli

check expo version
==>expo --version

In powershell execute it before creating expo app in desktop
==>Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Create project folder
==>expo init AwesomeProject

run app
==>yarn start

to run project
==>npm start / expo start

scan qr code on mobile

expo cli:
press a to open react-native app on android
press w to open react-native app on web
press r to reload app
press m to toggle menu

press ctrl + m to start hot reloading

to run app on web
==>expo start --web

install react js extension for web....then it will show code for mobile using it



====================================================================================
RUN APP THROUGH ANDROID STUIDO

globally install react native
==>npm install -g create-react-native-app

create app with name
==>create-react-native-app MyReactNative

install react native cli
==>npm install -g react-native-cli

==>npm run eject

start react native project
==>npm start
